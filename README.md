# Connect Four App

This is a web app that uses plain Javascript to play Connect Four locally between two players.

This was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's frontend curriculum. I've built about three Tic-Tac-Toe games in my time so I got bored and made a Connect Four instead of the suggested Tic Tac Toe game. My five year old sister got bored of this game in like 3 minutes so I want to figure out how to make this more engaging.

## To Do

## Acknowledgments

* My brother helped with the revision of this app. The idea of the game is obviously not my own and this is merely an adaption to a website rather than an original game.
